```
Creamy-white sea floating underneath a silver winged boat
  
      The ocean’s shallow waves joining the depth of the blue sky
      Sitting with its stillness, spanning a million miles

Lime-grey stone slab resting above a black wheeled submarine

      The marble’s jagged edge meeting the curves of the green seabed
      Spitting down the anger of the hailstorm

Orchid-magenta boa wrapping around a golden branched tree

      The serpent’s sharp teeth piercing through the softness of the rat’s skull
      Retreating to the darkness of its den

Uniform threads warping and weaving with each other

      The sea above the earth knitting into the warmth of a blanket
      Shielding the coldness of the night

Dimly lit moonlight soothing the ocean, the marble, the snake

       and the blanket, the cloud, that are now sparkling with serenity
       Regaining their energy before the sunrise
