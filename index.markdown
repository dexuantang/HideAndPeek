Welcome

-A Collection of Sentiments-

We often ignore the most simple things we see, hear, smell, feel, and tase in life. However, these senses are what make up of the meaning of being alive. Experiencing the senses, the feelings associated with these senses, and the anticipation of what the senses could be are what my writings focused on. On the surface, we see the colors and textures of the cloud, we hear the squealing of tires, we smell the scent of used things, we feel our spine touching the chair, and we taste the sweat of hard work. In our heart, we feel the serenity of nature, we think about the horror of possibly ruing over something, we read the story behind objects, we reflect on our habits, and we celebrate the process to our achievements. 


-An Experiment-

Walking around an object, perhaps your pen, keep your eye on it. What you see at any given moment is only a two-dimensional image of the shape of a pen. However, the human brain can stich thousands of these images together and realize the object you are seeing is a pen. Moreover, you realize the pen is made of metal, it is for writing, and maybe you have some sentiments attached to it. Perhaps you can also see the pen as a pathway to express these sentiments and see yourself picking it up in the next moment to write something. This ability to extrapolate is amazing, isn’t it?


-An Observatory-

Sitting by a campfire, watching the glowing amber, hearing the crackle, feeling the heat, smelling the burning ashes under the stary night. Watching objects as far as lightyears away: the Orion, the Arcturus, the Galactic Center, the Vega, the Capella, the Mars, the Mercury, the Moon… We are watching an image of their past, we are standing in the present, we can expand on their stories. 

Maybe the future is chaos, and we will never walk out of the dystopia. Or maybe everything will be just fine. All I can do is enjoy the present and jot my thoughts down.


# Cloud 
```
Creamy-white sea floating underneath a silver winged boat
  
      The ocean’s shallow waves joining the depth of the blue sky
      Sitting with its stillness, spanning a million miles

Lime-grey stone slab resting above a black wheeled submarine

      The marble’s jagged edge meeting the curves of the green seabed
      Spitting down the anger of the hailstorm

Orchid-magenta boa wrapping around a golden branched tree

      The serpent’s sharp teeth piercing through the softness of the rat’s skull
      Retreating to the darkness of its den

Uniform threads warping and weaving with each other

      The sea above the earth knitting into the warmth of a blanket
      Shielding the coldness of the night

Dimly lit moonlight soothing the ocean, the marble, the snake

       and the blanket, the cloud, that are now sparkling with serenity
       Regaining their energy before the sunrise
```
# Back Pain
```
   This is my spine
26 vertebrae supporting my body
  A few are probably displaced
    Strands of back muscles hugging it
       Screaming
         Screaming in pain from the pressure

         “Just don’t slouch so much!”
          “Just sit straight”
           Yes, this is the problem!
          Or is it?

         This is my brain
        Attached to the very end of my spinal cord
      It tells the muscles to relax
    So, my height won’t stand out
   Hiding
  Hiding from the words like

“Wow, you are so tall!”
“You must play basketball!”
  All seemingly compliments
  But why am I hiding from it?

   My brain tells my back muscles:
   “You can relax, once more
    let the spine stress the muscles
          let the body appear shorter
          Although the spine suffers
             I, the brain, can feel better.”

# The Moon, Too
```
Apep scrolls pass an app with a black icon as he walks down the six lanes stroad of 
Moon Colony Two wearing his Far Side Surveyor’s badge. His phone’s news feed 
keeps reminding him about people’s endless debate on the newly proposed ban on 
Moon resident’s exploration into the deeper space. He thinks to himself 
"The Democratic Republic of Earth’s bureaucracy sure is unchanged." 
In the past 15 years, the moon has become the hub of interplanetary colonization. 
The establishment of The Moon Colony One in 2050 marked the end of the World War III. 
People believed humans would finally unite once and for all as the construction of 
Moon Two and Moon Three went on in the following two decade. However, the 
expansion on the moon stopped at the edge of the back of the moon because 
the explorers who came back lost all their attachment to the Earth. Their memories 
of the old world, their will to ever come back to the Earth were all erased by the void. 
Those explorers now call themselves the “Lunarians”. The loading screen of the app with 
the black icon appears. The loading circle spins in suspension. The darkness 
inches forward in its circumference as it plots its revolt with the Lunarians and
the moon, too.

# Roadkill
CW: Description of animal death.
```
You were dead by the time I looked in my mirror. In front of you are 
streaks of blood red as a spilled bottle of ketchup. Your unrecognizable 
carcass slowly decomposing into a ball of fur and meat where flies will 
land on you and eat. Before you crossed this highway, you lived free in
the deep wood or the open sky where you once raced and glid. Perhaps you 
live in the city, in dumpsters and sewer pipes where you scavenged and 
dived. But now, hundreds of cars passing by you, watching you as you die. 

Little ball of fur and meat, Goodbye.

# My Home
```
Three maple trees standing in my dad’s front yard. He once said, 
“The three maple trees are also people who live in this home” 
Not long after that, the pandemic hit. Then a storm took down the 
weakest tree standing alone in the corner and cut the branch that 
connected the other two trees together. The once dense branches that 
hug each other now has a giant gap between them like the Pacific Ocean 
that is standing between me and my family. One day, the stomp of the fallen 
tree grew sprout. The branches of the other two trees are also slowly growing 
back. The house right next to the trees still stands, despite being much 
quieter. It has became our home since the day my family moved in and it will
always wait for my family to reunite one day. 
```

# Deep Sky Objects
```
Looking up the starry night:
The Mars, the Venus,
The Mimosa, the Vega,
The Milky Way, the Virgo A.
Tiny specks of dust in the sky.
 
Observing from the present:
Photons from light years away,
Sensed by my retina,
Images of a distant world,
Of as far as 2.5 million years in the past.

Is someone faraway also looking at the Earth’s past?
Looking at an Earth before life,
And believing they are alone in this universe?
