## Why we built it?
      For our B-term 2022 ECE2799 class project, We decided to update the Atwater Kent building with interactive displays. 
      Our design team would like to provide visitors with a portal to all information related to ECE.
      This display is designed to be connected to the internet to get new contents every day. 
      You could scan the QR code on the E-paper display for more information of the content displayed on the big screen.
## How we built it?
      Here is an overview of the systems block diagram.
