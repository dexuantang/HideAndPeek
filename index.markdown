-A Collection of Sentiments-

We often ignore the most simple things we see, hear, smell, feel, and tase in life. However, these senses are what make up of the meaning of being alive. Experiencing the senses, the feelings associated with these senses, and the anticipation of what the senses could be are what my writings focused on. On the surface, we see the colors and textures of the cloud, we hear the squealing of tires, we smell the scent of used things, we feel our spine touching the chair, and we taste the sweat of hard work. In our heart, we feel the serenity of nature, we think about the horror of possibly ruing over something, we read the story behind objects, we reflect on our habits, and we celebrate the process to our achievements. 


-An Experiment-

Walking around an object, perhaps your pen, keep your eye on it. What you see at any given moment is only a two-dimensional image of the shape of a pen. However, the human brain can stich thousands of these images together and realize the object you are seeing is a pen. Moreover, you realize the pen is made of metal, it is for writing, and maybe you have some sentiments attached to it. Perhaps you can also see the pen as a pathway to express these sentiments and see yourself picking it up in the next moment to write something. This ability to extrapolate is amazing, isn’t it?


-A Planetarium-

Sitting by a campfire, watching the glowing amber, hearing the crackle, feeling the heat, smelling the burning ashes under the stary night. Watching objects as far as lightyears away: the Orion, the Arcturus, the Galactic Center, the Vega, the Capella, the Mars, the Mercury, the Moon… We are watching an image of their past, we are standing in the present, we can expand on their stories. 

Maybe the future is chaos, and we will never walk out of the dystopia. Or maybe everything will be just fine. All we can do is to jot our thoughts down.
